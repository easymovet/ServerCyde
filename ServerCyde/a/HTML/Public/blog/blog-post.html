                                While working building out the JS library to allow secure client side connections
                                to Amazon SimpleDB we thought of adding a COMET service! It sounded like so much
                                fun to build that we got side tracked and while the DB implementation is at about
                                50% the COMET implementation is done!</p>
                            <p>
                                There are only 2 methods needed to harness COMET on our site: Subscribe and Publish.
                                You subscribe to a channel using this line from the browser:
                                <br />
                                <b>ServerCyde.Comet.Subscribe(1, function (data) { alert("message:" + data); });</b><br />
                                then when you publish something anyone who is connected to channel 1 will get the
                                published message INSTANTLY, no repeated polling required. Publishing a message
                                is just as easy:
                                <br />
                                <b>ServerCyde.Comet.Publish(1, "New person online!", null, function (data) { });</b></p>
                            <p>
                                We are pretty close to releasing a beta. Email templates are almost done, you will
                                be able to add information for an SMTP server of your choosing like SendGrid (we
                                use PostMark) and setup some templates that you can trigger a send from the client
                                using only JS. That's right, you will be sending emails using only JS!</p>
                            <p>
                                As always we love your feedback on features, or just plain excitement :)</p>

                                I just got back from my first bootstrapper's breakfast here in Chicago. It was a
                                great event to meet entrepreneurs who all have similar challenges. The moderator
                                at my table was very knowledgeable and was very willing to share his expertise.
                                So what was the focus? There were three main points: 1) how to reach your customers
                                organically on the cheap; 2) how to reward early partners; 3) how to set your price.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1) How to your reach your customers organically on the cheap. The main consensus
                                at our table was to become a thought leader in your area. There are two main ways
                                to do that. The first is to ask thought provoking questions of your customers and
                                peers. This strategy allows you to build a growing list of individuals who will
                                read your question, see if it applies to their situation, and answer it from their
                                perspective. Second, you should be constantly looking for questions that need quality
                                answers and answer those in which you can provide such a substantive answer. Both
                                of these strategies should be used without pushing your product and both require
                                an active presence on particular websites, LinkedIn was suggested. It is a hard
                                task, of course, to talk amongst your target market without pushing your product.
                                However, in the long term, a certain amount of equity is built in the organic conversations
                                between you and your potential customers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Speaking of equity, 2) how to reward early partners or employees. Going into this
                                breakfast it was my understanding that at the earliest stage of a bootstrapped startup,
                                equity is really the only path. While still an important consideration, there is
                                also the option of a promised share of profits. Additionally, if equity is what's
                                on the table, it is vital to get the terms in writing. Get it in writing even if
                                the relationship between you and the partner is good now; think of it as insurance
                                for that relationship. Some good things to have is a three or four year vesting
                                period with a one year “cliff”. A “cliff” means that the partner is basically on
                                probation for the first year, gaining no vested interest until after completing
                                the first year. But a vested interested interest is no good unless you're making
                                money.</p>
                            <p>
                                3) How to set your price. We touched on this last point only briefly and this seemed
                                to be taken not so seriously. One suggestion was just to ask your customers what
                                their willingness-to-pay is for the service. However, given my exposure to willingness-to-pay
                                in economics, I have a somewhat cynical view of this; one's stated willingness-to-pay
                                is not exactly what they actually will pay. Another idea was to be under the threshold
                                of the so-called expense or approval line. That is, charge only enough so the customer
                                does not have to seek approval to pay for your service and that they can simply
                                expense it on their company card. Finally, a bit of cynicism from the older people
                                at my table came through when they brought up doing a market analysis and suggesting
                                that maybe there is no market and you should just give up. I don't think that is
                                the best advice, and I surely will not be heeding it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All in all, I learned a bunch from this breakfast. It was $5 to attend and the food
                                was pretty cheap. Even if I did not learn any of the above things, the opportunity
                                to talk about my start up in front of other people was worth the cost of attendance.
                                I have another event that I am going to tomorrow night where I am to give a short
                                presentation, so the extra practice this breakfast gave me was invaluable. Hope
                                to see you at the next bootstrapper's breakfast.</p>

                                I got an e-mail from <a href="http://startupdigest.com/">StartupDigest</a> today,
                                a great resource for people like us at ServerCyde, and one of the links was for
                                free JavaScript lessons provided by <a href="http://learn.appendto.com/lessons">appendto.com</a>.
                                I checked them out and they seem pretty good, especially for someone like me. Due
                                to my status as a full time law student, father, entrepreneur, and futures trader,
                                I don't get many opportunities to code. But since the ServerCyde beta is launching
                                soon, I really need to brush up my skills.
                            </p>

                                ServerCyde aims to let developers utilize JavaScript in the most powerful way while
                                also expanding its capability to cover the server-side code typically required for
                                a data driven web app. So if your JavaScript is a little rusty, like mine, check
                                out the tutorials and by the time the ServerCyde beta program launches, you'll be
                                ready to go.

                                When turning a business idea into reality the major considerations are cost, time
                                to market, and scaling strategy. Cost is key. If you have a lot of money, then by
                                some entrepreneurial standards you've already succeeded. If you are boot strapping
                                like the rest of us, then you want your product to go live - yesterday. You want
                                something to pitch to potential investors before the competition beats you to it.
                                That's where ServerCyde comes in. Instead of hiring n-tier developers, you simply
                                need a designer who knows JavaScript to use ServerCyde tools. Using ServerCyde will
                                save designers from spending time building boilerplate code and allow them to manage
                                things like sign-ups, Facebook connect, and data storage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Building an app entirely in JavaScript has the secondary advantage of putting most
                                of the processing task on the client. This scales very well because every new client
                                is also a new "server." In essence, it scales on it's own. Building your app in
                                HTML/CSS/JavaScript and using ServerCyde is particularly successful because it works
                                on every platform and is future-proof. The ServerCyde platform is currently adding
                                services to handle image uploads and manipulation, encryption, and email templates
                                that will let you build rich apps all on the client.

                                Have you ever tried pitching a website to someone without having a prototype? Image
                                pitching Twitter would go something like this: "You can only post 140 letters and
                                other people are notified when you make a new post.” Without seeing the end product
                                most people would think the idea is terrible. After all, who would want to read
                                just 140 letters without useful content? With no prototype, even the best idea is
                                a difficult sell. Instead of creating a 5 year scalability plan, code the project
                                today and start getting customers now. Sign up for ServerCyde beta now and get updates
                                on our development.
